Dear Ms. Brezovnik,

I’m writing you this email out of concerns for digital threats. 

Malware is getting more and more sophisticated, and the techniques of mitigating online attacks that people know are, in some cases, not enough anymore. 

What’s important from a technical standpoint is DNS. By setting the address of a desired DNS server, you can block sites that often induce malware—adult content, pirated films, etc cetera. The DNS server will also not let you access a website if it has been reported as compromised. 

Another mythical tool that became a reality because of the digital transformation is cloud analysis of files. You can have the possibly malicious file sent to a company that specialises in security directly from the antivirus software, where it gets analysed in a “sandbox”—a computer that is isolated, “prepared” to be infected. After that is done they observe the consequences and send bock a report. 

I hope you and your colleagues will consider some of these newly available technologies. 

Best regards,
Nik Golinar
