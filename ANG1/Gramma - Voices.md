**Active voice** 
When the “doer of the action” is the subject, he performs the verb

“He ate an apple.”
- he is the **subject**
- ate is the **verb**
- apple is the **object**

 
**Passive voice**
When the subject is the patient, undergoer or target of the action.

“An apple was eaten by them.”

We use passive to emphasise that the action is more important than the person who did it.


When turning active into passive:
- The object and subject switch places
- An object becomes a “patient” and
- a subject becomes an “agent”.

- We use a verb in the 3rd form, preceded by the auxiliary verb be.
